Hi, welcome to my website!
<br>
I specialize in GenAI foundation models with 2+ years of experience developing generative models that manipulate real-world scenes based on human instructions. My work leverages large-scale industry datasets to create cutting-edge solutions in both image/video generation/editing and multi-modal perception models, with applications including autonomous driving. During my PhD research, I focused on multi-domain model adaptation, designing systems that effectively handle cross-domain variations while minimizing the need for human supervision.
