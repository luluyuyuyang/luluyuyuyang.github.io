Hi, welcome to my website!
<br>
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student from University of Maryland Perception & Intelligence Lab, working with [Prof. Abhinav Shrivastava](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~abhinav/) and [Prof. Larry Davis](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~lsd/). My research interests lie in domain adaptation and robustness learning, mainly from the perspective of vision.

*New! Our paper on DeCoTa on Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation is accepted by ICCV 2021. Someone made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RJQGTOPeBU) for it, thanks!*
